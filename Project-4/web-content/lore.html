                <h2>Godrick the Grafted Grime Cake</h2>
                <p>A grotesque, multi-layered horror, representing the foolish ambition of combining too many flavors. Its frosting is thick and unyielding, a testament to his desperation.</p>

                <h2>Rennala, Queen of the Full Sponge</h2>
                <p>A simple, yet perfectly executed yellow sponge cake. It is light, airy, and utterly perfect, reflecting her celestial grace and delicate control over the batter.</p>

                <h2>Malenia, Blade of Meringue</h2>
                <p>A legendary torte, featuring a delicate, razor-sharp meringue that is deceptively brittle. One bite is all it takes to succumb to the "Scarlet Rot" of spice and heat.</p>
